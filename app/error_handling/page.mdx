# Error Handling

Our API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the outcome of an API request.  
Codes in the **2xx** range indicate success, **4xx** indicates client-side issues (such as missing or invalid parameters), and **5xx** indicates server-side errors.

API error responses are returned in JSON format, and the HTTP status code is included in the response headers.  
While the error message and type may vary, the **error code ID and its meaning remain consistent**.

We aim to fail gracefully whenever possible. When an issue is encountered, the API returns the best available data along with additional warnings, known as **soft errors**. Hard errors are also reported in a structured format.

## Request ID

Each API request has a unique request identifier.
You can find this value in the response headers under X-Correlation-ID.

If you need support with a specific request, providing this identifier will ensure the fastest resolution.
