# Versioning

---

One of the things that sets the **Tomorrow.io REST Weather API** apart is our ability to rapidly support emerging climate- and weather-related use cases and get them to production quickly. As our REST weather API evolves with new data points, our first focus is always on developer satisfaction.

When additions are made to the API, they will be posted in our **Change Log**.

---

## Backward Compatible Changes

The version **will not** be incremented when we do one of the following:

- Add attributes to returned JSON objects  
- Add *non-required* query/body parameters  
- Change the default number of items returned in a single page request  
- Change error messages or type texts

---

## Backward Incompatible Changes

The version **will** be incremented when we do one of the following:

- Add *required* query/body parameters  
- Change the data types of attributes/parameters  
  *(e.g., string → array, number → string, etc.)*
- Remove attributes from returned JSON objects  
- Remove existing query/body parameters

If we ever run into an edge case where any of the above updates must be made (which has not happened yet), we will notify all customers **well in advance** and provide a transition plan where appropriate.

---

## Tolerance

The best way to build against the **Tomorrow.io REST Weather API** and account for additions is to be as **tolerant** as possible:

- Ignore attributes/parameters that are not necessary  
- Avoid parsing everything into strongly-typed objects when unnecessary

If this is not feasible for your project — or if your tech stack makes tolerance difficult — reach out to us so we can explore alternative solutions.

If you have any feedback on our update process or our product roadmap, **we would love to hear from you.**
