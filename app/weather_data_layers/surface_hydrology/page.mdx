# Surface Hydrology Layer 
---


| Surface Hydrology Layer | Definition | Calculations |
|-------------------------|------------|--------------|
|Surface Runoff|Surface runoff defined as excess water that flows over the land surface because the soil cannot absorb it fast enough. Units m3/sec|Runoff=P−I−ET−ΔS, P is precipitation, I is infiltration, ET is evapotranspiration, ΔS is change in soil storage|
|Drainage density |Drainage density is a measure of how densely a drainage network is packed into a landscape. It describes the total length of all streams and rivers in a drainage basin divided by the area of that basin. Units Km/Km2|Dd = L/A, L = total length of all streams/channels in the basin (km or m), A = area of the drainage basin (km² or m²)|
|River Discharge |River discharge is the volume of water flowing through a river channel per unit time. It tells how much water is moving past a specific point in the river. Units m3/sec|Q=A×V, A is the cross sectional area of the river (m2) and V is the average velocity of the river (m/sec).|
