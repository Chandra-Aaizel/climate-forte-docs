| Air Quality Parameter | Definition | Calculations |
|------------------------|------------|--------------|
|Aerosol Optical Depth |Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is the measure of aerosols (e.g., urban haze, smoke particles, desert dust, sea salt) distributed within a column of air. Dimensionless quantity|τ = ∫α(z)dz, α here stands for aerosol extinction coefficient at height |
|Angstorm Exponent |It is used to infer the aerosol particle size distribution within a cloumn of air. |​α=−ln(τλ1/τλ2)/ln(λ1/λ2) λ1 and λ2 two different wavelenghts in m.|
|UV Index|UV Index widely used parameter to characterize solar UV. Information about it can be useful for helping people avoid excessive levels of UV radiation.|UVI=Eeff​​/25mW/m2, Eeff= effective UV irradiance|
|Particulate Matter (PM)|Particulate Matter  a combination of soild particles and liquid droplets present in the air composed of both fine and coarse particles. Coarse particles (PM10) have an aerodynamic diameter between 2.5µm and 10µm. Fine particles have an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5µm (PM2.5). Units µg/m3.|PMx​=Mparticles/​​V air, Mparticles= mass of collected particles (micrograms, µg), V|
|NOx|NOx, or nitrogen oxides, refers to a group of gases that include nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which are significant air pollutants. Units ppb|NOₓ =  NO + NO₂|
|SO2|SO₂ (Sulfur Dioxide) is a gaseous air pollutant consisting of sulfur and oxygen, primarily produced by combustion of sulfur-containing fuels (like coal and oil) and industrial processes. Units ppb|SO2 (concentration) = mass of SO2 (µg)/ Volume of air sample (m3).|
|CO|CO is the amount of carbon monoxide in the air, which can be harmful because it binds with hemoglobin in the blood, reducing oxygen transport in the body. Units ppm|CO (concentration) = mass of CO (mg)/ Volume of air sample (m3)|
|O3|A secondary pollutant, formed by photochemical reactions between NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in sunlight. ppb|O3 (concentration) = mass of O3 (µg)/ Volume of air sample (m3)|
|VOCs|Volatile Organic Carbon (VOC), more commonly called Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), refers to a large group of organic chemicals that easily evaporate at room temperature and contribute to air pollution.|VOCs (concentration) = mass of VOC (µg)/ Volume of air sample (m3)|
|Visibility|Visibility is the maximum distance at which a prominent object can be seen and recognized in the atmosphere under prevailing conditions of light and air clarity.|V = 3.912/σ, σ = atmospheric extinction coefficient (1/m)|
|Surface Albedo |Surface albedo is the fraction of incoming solar radiation (shortwave radiation) that is reflected by a surface back into the atmosphere, without being absorbed. Dimensionless |Albedo = Reflected solar radiation/Incoming solar radiation |
