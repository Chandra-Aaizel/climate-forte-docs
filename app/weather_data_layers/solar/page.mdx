| Solar Radiation layers | Definition | Calculations |
|------------------------|------------|--------------|
|Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)|The power per unit area received from the Sun on a surface normal (perpendicular) to the Sun’s rays. Units W/m2|Ib​ = I0 ​X τ, I0 = Solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere, τ is transmittance|
|Diffuse Solar Radiation|Solar radiation that reaches the surface after being scattered by air molecules, aerosols, and clouds. It does not come directly from the Sun. Units W/m2|NA|
|Global Solar Radiation|The total solar radiation received on a horizontal surface, including both direct and diffuse components. Units W/m2|Ig​= Ib​cosθz​ + Id​ |
|Outgoing Longwave Radiation|Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) is the thermal infrared radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, atmosphere, and clouds back to space. Units W/m2|NA|
