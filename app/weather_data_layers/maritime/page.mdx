| Maritime Layers| Definition | Calculations |
|----------------|------------|--------------|
|Sea Surface Temperature |Sea surface temperature referes to the temperature of water at the ocean surface, it is an important indicator of global ocean conditions. Units Kelvin|NA|
|Sea Surface Pressure |It is a total pressure at a point in the ocean that may results from both due to the weight of the seawater above it and the atmospheric pressure. Units in Pa|NA|
|Sea surface winds|Sea surface winds are the horizontal wind speeds and directions measured just above the ocean surface. Units m/sec|wind stress at surface τ=ρa​Cd​U2, ρa= air density, Cd = drag coefficient|
|Salinity |The concentration of dissolved salts in ocean water is called the salinity. While the total dissolved salts varies from place to place in the ocean due to evaporation, precipitation, river inflow, and mixing, the ratio among the various major dissolved salts remains essentially constant.|S = (mass of dissolved salts/mass of sea water) X 100|
|Dissolved Oxygen|Dissolved Oxygen (DO) is the amount of molecular oxygen (O₂) dissolved in water and available for aquatic organisms to breathe. Units mg/L|Saturation concentration of oxygen in water depends on temperature and salinity.  DOsat​=14.621−0.41022T+0.0079910T2−0.000077774T3|
|Nutrients|Nutrients are essential chemical elements or compounds that support biological activity and primary production in ecosystems. (Nitrate, Phosphorous).  Units mg/L|NA|
|Cholorophyll|Chlorophyll concentration is the amount of chlorophyll pigment (primarily chlorophyll-a) present in a volume of water. Units mg/m3|NA|
