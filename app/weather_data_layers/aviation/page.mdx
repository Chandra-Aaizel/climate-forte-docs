| Low Level Altitudes/Aviation | Definition | Calculations |
|------------------------------|------------|--------------|
|Low level winds (0-300m)|Winds very close to the ground, directly influenced by surface friction, terrain, and land-use features. Units m/sec|U(z)=(u*/k) X​​ ln(z/z0​​),  u* is the friction velocity, Z0 is the surface roughness lenght. |
|Vertical velocity|Vertical velocity in meteorology usually refers to the vertical motion of air (updrafts or downdrafts). Units Pa/sec|NA|
