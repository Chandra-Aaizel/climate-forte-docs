| Vegetation/Agriculture parameters | Definition | Calculations |
|-----------------------------------|------------|--------------|
|Leaf Area Index (LAI)|LAI represents the total leaf surface area per unit ground area, typically considering the one-sided area of leaves. Units m2/m2|LAI=total one-sided leaf area​/ground surface area|
|NDVI|NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is a widely used remote sensing index that measures vegetation greenness, health, and density using reflected light in the red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths.|NDVI = NIR -Red/NIR + Red|
|Land Use Land Cover (LULC)|Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) refers to the classification and description of the Earth’s surface based on how land is used by humans and what physical materials or vegetation cover it.|Classification|
|Crop Classification|Crop classification refers to the process of identifying and mapping different crop types over agricultural fields using ground observations, remote sensing data|Classification|
